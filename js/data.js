All my life I went to the goal: I studied well, worked hard, developed. And only after entering KPI I was able to fulfill my dream and open my own online store of electronic equipment. For this I am grateful, of course, not to the university, but to my environment, into which I found myself when I came to study. These are the people who have always supported me, helped me in everything. At this stage, I understand that all the changes that take place in life are for the better, and falls help you learn to get up and move on to your dream. The experience gained is the most important thing! Thank you for reading up to this point, I started to write it as a joke to fill this page, but by the end I was so drawn in that I wanted to write something from the heart, enjoy the site :)'],
